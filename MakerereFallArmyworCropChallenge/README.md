# Makerere Fall Armyworm Crop Challenge

Can you determine if maize crops have been affected by the fall armyworm pest?

## Context
Fall armyworm is a devastating pest in Africa, where it has no natural predators - African farmers say the pest causes average maize losses of 31% annually.
Maize is the most widely grown crop in Africa and a staple for around half the continentâ€™s people - over 300 million Africans depend 
on the crop for food and nutritional security. For smallholder farmers in particular, maize is popular for its wide adaptability, valuable by-products and high yields.

Because of this reliance on staple crops for food security, Viral pests and diseases like fall armyworm are one of the leading causes of food 
insecurity and poverty in Africa. Thus there is an urgent need to design early intervention mechanisms to help prevent crop losses for smallholder farmers.

## Objective
In this challenge, your objective is to classify if a plant has been affected by a fall armyworm.
This is a binary image classification challenge. 
The solution will be deployed as part of a mobile-based edge application which can be used by smallholder farmers in Uganda and the rest of Africa to carry 
out field-based diagnosis and intervene before fall armyworm devastates their maize crop for the season.

## Data
The dataset contains images of maize crop leaves collected by research scientists from the Makerere Artificial Intelligence Lab, 
the Marconi Machine Learning Lab, and the National Crops Research Institute in Uganda. It contains 2699 images equally distributed across the healthy 
and fall armyworm classes.

The dataset does not contain any other attributes associated with the images. Images have not been subjected to any form of preprocessing.
